<p>Hello and Welcome:</p>
<p>Very often, gardeners do things as though we are little farmers, such as planting our gardens in long straight rows. Instead, planting in circles and other ways are often better for our gardening purposes and we can do so because we don't have to drive tractors in straight lines in our fields. The Native American "Three Sisters" planting method is an example of a gardening-centric approach. This website will explore circular gardening and you are welcome to check back for new information.</p>
